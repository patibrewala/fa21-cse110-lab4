**Q1.** Line 12 will print the number 3. This is because the input price array was of size 3 so the for loop ran till i variable became 3.

**Q2.** Line 13 will print the number 150. This is because the last price in the array was 300 and the discount was 0.5 which made the discountedPrice 150.

**Q3.** Line 14 will also print the number 150. This is because the calculations made to the discountedPrice gives 150 as result.

**Q4.** The function returns an array with 3 elements [50, 100, 150]. 
    All of the finalPrice (calculted with discountedPrice) are added to the discounted array through the for loop and this array is returned by the function. 

**Q5.** Line 12 throws an error, 'i is not defined'. This is because line 12 is trying to access a let variable outside its scope. i is a let variable defined in the for loop so its scope is limited to the for loop block and cannt be used outside it.

**Q6.** Line 13 throws an error, 'discountedPrice is not defined'. This is because line 13 is trying to access a let variable outside its scope. discountedPrice is a let variable defined in the for loop so its scope is limited to the for loop block and cannt be used outside it.

**Q7.** Line 14 will print the number 150. This is because the calculations made to the discountedPrice gives 150 as result. Also, the scope of finalPrice is the function block which means line 14 is accessing this let variable inside its scope and there will be no error.

**Q8.** The function returns an array with 3 elements [50, 100, 150]. 
    All of the finalPrice (calculted with discountedPrice) are added to the discounted array through the for loop and this array is returned by the function. 
    
**Q9.** Line 11 throws an error, 'i is not defined'. This is because line 11 is trying to access a let variable outside its scope. i is a let variable defined in the for loop so its scope is limited to the for loop block and cannt be used outside it.

**Q10.** Line 12 will print the number 3. This is because length variable is a constant whose value is the length of the price array which is 3. 

**Q11.** The function returns an array with 3 elements [50, 100, 150]. 
    All of the discountedPrice(s) are calculated and added to the discounted array through the for loop and this array is returned by the function.
